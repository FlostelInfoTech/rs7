## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-19

### Changed - HL7 Standards Compliance 🔧

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Terser segment indexing changed from 0-based to 1-based to match HAPI and HL7 conventions.

- **Terser Segment Indexing (BREAKING)**:
  - Changed from 0-based to 1-based indexing for segment access
  - `OBX(1)` now refers to the **first** OBX segment (previously second)
  - `OBX(2)` now refers to the **second** OBX segment (previously third)
  - `OBX` without index still refers to the first OBX segment
  - Attempting to use index 0 (e.g., `OBX(0)`) now returns an error
  - This matches HAPI's convention and aligns with HL7's 1-based field numbering

- **Migration Guide**:
  - Review all code using segment indexing in Terser paths
  - Update indexed segment references: `OBX(N)` → `OBX(N+1)` for N > 0
  - First segment: `OBX(0)` → `OBX` or `OBX(1)`
  - Second segment: `OBX(1)` → `OBX(2)`
  - Third segment: `OBX(2)` → `OBX(3)`, etc.

### Fixed

- **ACK Message Generation**:
  - ACK messages now correctly include trigger event in MSH-9
  - Format changed from `"ACK"` to `"ACK^{trigger}"` (e.g., `"ACK^A01"` for ADT^A01)
  - Complies with HL7 v2.x acknowledgment message standards

### Documentation

- Updated all examples to use 1-based segment indexing
- Updated README.md, CLAUDE.md, and crate READMEs with correct indexing
- Clarified that component and subcomponent indexing remains 1-based (unchanged)
- Added migration notes for upgrading from 0.6.x
